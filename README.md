# Freesound

  * This project is to solve a kaggle challenge ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/ )  : Build a model which can learn  9000 audio files classified into 41. The model should predict when a new file from this 41 is supplied 
  * Training set was in wav format sound files, suitable python packages are used to convert these into keras requisted format 
  * Appropriate  metrics and suitable benchmark methods to measure each learning iteration and tuning the model to improve accuracy.
  * An application which can understand and classify sound file could be implemented for various use cases.
